# How to use
1. Copy the script.js content into your Tampermonkey browser plugin
2. Go to any Github-PR and press F2
3. You will realize that "Clear"-, "Hide"- and "Ignore"-Buttons will appear
* Click "Hide" to hide a part of the pr history
* Click "Ignore" to remove the "Hide"-/"Ignore"-Button for a part of the history
* Click "Clear" to undo the hiding/ignoring for this PR
The hiding/ignoring is saved to local storage.
